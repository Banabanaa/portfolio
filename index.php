                Ever since senior high school, I‚Äôve had a spark of curiosity that led me to explore the world of technology, which is why I chose Computer Science as my course. It wasn‚Äôt always easy, and there were moments when things didn‚Äôt click right away, but through trial and error in my academic projects and persistence to learn, I gradually taught myself the ins and outs of different programming languages and concepts.

              <p class="m-0">
                I am someone who finds joy in exploring ideas or hobbies, I like making crafts and enjoy leisure (I mean, who doesn‚Äôt?), because I believe a good balance is key to staying inspired and doing my best work. Which is why playing online games or billiards help fuel my creativity. I tend to overthink sometimes, but that also means I notice the little details and catch issues early on. I‚Äôm naturally introverted, which allows me to stay focused and intentional in how I work. Every project I take on is a chance to grow, connect, and create with a strong sense of purpose and responsibility.</p>

              <h2>Family Background</h2>
              </div>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Coming from a broken family has shaped much of who I am today. My mother separated from us when I was a teenager, and since then, 
              I've been deeply motivated to focus on my studies and personal growth. With my father working hard as a technician and my older brother 
              supporting a family of his own, I‚Äôve felt a strong responsibility to contribute and make something meaningful out of my journey. 
              These experiences have instilled in me a sense of resilience, purpose, and a deep drive to succeed‚Äînot just for myself, but for the people who believe in me.
            </p><br>
            <p>Because of everything I‚Äôve been through, I‚Äôve come to really appreciate my friends. They‚Äôve become like my second 
              family, my rock‚Äîalways there when I need them. Spending time with them keeps me grounded, and honestly, I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd be without them.
              And then there are my two cats, Luna and Iris. They‚Äôre sweet but a little bit naughty, they‚Äôve been with me through it all, 
              keeping me warm (literally and emotionally), when I'm with them, I am reminded to slow down and enjoy the little moments.</p>
