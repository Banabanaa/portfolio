       <h2>Growth Through Challenges</h2>
       <p>
        My story isn’t perfect, but it’s mine—and it’s made me who I am. I’m the youngest in a small family, with one older brother. When my mom left, everything changed. It left a gap in our home that couldn’t be filled, and over time, things got even harder. My dad struggled with drinking, my brother moved out, and I found myself trying to keep things together the best I could.

        <br><br>

        Even with everything going on at home, I never gave up on my education. In fact, it became my motivation. I worked harder, studied more, and pushed myself to keep going no matter what. At the same time, I took on responsibilities like heading the household chores, juggling school deadlines, staying active in organizations, and taking on side gigs to apply for scholarships and help my family. It’s a lot, but I’ve learned how to manage my time, prioritize what matters, and stay focused.

        <br><br>

        These challenges didn’t break me—they built me. I’ve learned to adapt, to step up when things get tough, and to keep moving forward even when it feels impossible. I may not always have everything figured out, but I’ve never backed down from a challenge. I show up, I do the work, and I try to be better than I was yesterday.

        <br><br>

        The photos and moments you’ll see here aren’t just highlights—they’re parts of a bigger story. They represent the late nights, the tough choices, the small wins, and the quiet strength it took to get here. I’m still on that journey, still chasing my dreams, and still working hard every single day. And I’m proud of how far I’ve come.
