          <div class="card-divider"></div>
            <p>
              My story isn’t perfect, but it’s mine, and it’s made me who I am. I’m the youngest in a small family, with one older brother. When my mom left, everything changed. It left a gap in our home that couldn’t be filled, and over time, things got even harder. My dad struggled with drinking, my brother moved out, and I found myself trying to keep things together the best I could.
              <br><br>
              Even with everything going on at home, I never gave up on my education. In fact, it became my motivation. I worked harder, studied more, and pushed myself to keep going no matter what. At the same time, I took on responsibilities like heading the household chores, juggling school deadlines, staying active in organizations, and taking on side gigs to apply for scholarships and help my family. It’s a lot, but I’ve learned how to manage my time, prioritize what matters, and stay focused.
              <br><br>
              These challenges didn’t break me, they built me. I’ve learned to adapt, to step up when things get tough, and to keep moving forward even when it feels impossible. I may not always have everything figured out, but I’ve never backed down from a challenge. I show up, I do the work, and I try to be better than I was yesterday.
              <br><br>
              The photos and moments you’ll see here aren’t just highlights—they’re parts of a bigger story. They represent the late nights, the tough choices, the small wins, and the quiet strength it took to get here. I’m still on that journey, still chasing my dreams, and still working hard every single day. And I’m proud of how far I’ve come.

          <h3 class="card-title">Being a Student Leader</h3>
          <div class="card-divider"></div>
             <p>
                The skills of becoming a leader wasn't born with me, it was something I grew into. At first, I doubted myself, unsure if anyone would take me seriously. I was young, quiet, and not the loudest voice in the room.
                <br><br>
                Being a student leader since elementary, I have often felt the pressure to balance my academic life with my responsibilities in the organization. It’s a challenge I willingly took on, but it hasn’t been without its struggles. The demands of leadership can be overwhelming, as it requires a significant amount of time and effort. As a student who constantly strives for awards and recognition, the weight of balancing both schoolwork and organizational duties sometimes feels like too much. Despite these challenges, I have learned to push through and manage my responsibilities the best as I can.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, I’ve come to realize that being a leader is not just about taking charge but also about being resilient and adaptable. Criticism from peers and the student body has been part of the journey, and I’ve had to learn not to take it personally. Instead of letting it discourage me, I’ve learned to embrace it as a tool for self-improvement. I now view each challenge as an opportunity to grow and become a better leader. It has taught me not to give up easily and to keep working hard, knowing that success comes through perseverance and learning from every experience.
                <br><br>
                These struggles taught me the kind of leader I want to be: resilient, empathetic, and authentic. And I know that even when I stumble, I’m still growing, and that's what matters the most for me.

          <h3 class="card-title">Programming Experiences</h3>
          <div class="card-divider"></div>
            <p>
               When I first started coding, I found it difficult and often felt overwhelmed by the complexity of the concepts. I wasn’t particularly skilled, and  understanding what I was doing seemed like a constant struggle. Many times, I found myself stuck, unsure of how to fix errors or make progress. However, as I continued to create and experiment, I began to understand the logic behind the code. Each mistake was an opportunity to learn and improve, and the more I worked through these challenges, the more confident I became in my abilities.
              <br><br>
               Being the leader of the projects we had at university also played a significant role in this growth. It forced me to step up, take responsibility, and dive deeper into the learning process, helping me hone my skills and adapt quickly.
              <br><br>
               Through this journey, I’ve realized that coding is a lot like life, where it’s a process of trial and error. If something doesn’t work, I know that I just need to try again, learn from what went wrong, and keep pushing forward until I get the right result. This mindset has shaped how I approach everything I do. I don’t want to give up easily. I believe that hard work, perseverance, and a willingness to keep going, even after setbacks, are key to success, both in coding and in life.
